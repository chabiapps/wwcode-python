 
print - won't print 2 diferent types of variable
ex: print(<int>a, <string>b)

input - generates a string result
      - you have to typecast it if you want it to not be a string
      - you have to typecast it before performing any operations

There's 2 different ways of printing strings
print('string {}'.format(<variable>)
//string variable_value

print(f'string {variable}')

python is sensitive to spacing since it doesn't have any terminator like the semicolon on other programming languages.

alias python = python3
